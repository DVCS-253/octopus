Files:
1, workspace.rb: the implementation of two funtions clean and commit
2, workspace_testcases.rb: test cases for functions in workspace.rb
3, commit_histroy1, commit_history2, commit_history3: three standard files for testing if the commit log files are generated properly
4, README


Detials:
1, clean is designed to deleted all unstaged files. In other words, delete all the files and directories in workspace except for staged_folder (where the staged files are located)
and files, whose name starts with '.' or '..' such as '.commit_history'.
2, commit is designed more like 'stage' function in our previous design. When commit a file or directory, the function makes a copy of the file or directory in staged_folder directory. Meanwhile, the function will keep track of each file by adding a record in the log file (.commit_histroy).


Test:
1, clean is tested by checking if files in staged_folder and '.commit_history' stay unchanged while other files are deleted from workspace
2, commit is tested in three parts: commit(), commit(directory) and commit(file). The basic idea is testing is the files or directories are copied properly to staged_folder. After that, we test if the log file (.commit_history) is generated correctly. To test the correctness of log files, we manually generated three log files as the right answer in testing.
